The **Business Strategy Lab** is a living repository of strategic frameworks, tools, and decision-making artifacts for C-Level executives, digital leaders, and enterprise consultants. It bridges the gap between business models and the technologies that make them possible.

This repository is part of our [Applied AI · XAI](https://www.josenanez.com/verticales/xai) vertical and contains practical agents, frameworks, and tools to automate real business challenges — ethically and at scale.
